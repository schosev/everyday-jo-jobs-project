About:

Everyday Jo Jobs is a site for bringing together the people that do odd jobs and the people that need odd jobs done. Members sign up and put in their basic contact info, location city/state, and 3 skills along with their hourly rate. Once logged in you can read through the home page to see other users and the skills they do. Just find what you're looking for, contact the user, and work out the details of the job needing done. 


Technologies used:

HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS UI, jQuery for DOM manipulation, Express for routing, Sequelize for the Database, Node for the server and package management, Heroku for hosting, and Passport for authentication.
